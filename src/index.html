            Coding is not a difficult task in the same way that learning the
            rules of chess is not a difficult task.

            Anyone can learn what a for-loop is. Anyone can learn what a
            while-loop is. Anyone can learn what a variable is. All just as
            easily as someone can learn how to move a pawn or a rook, but
            learning how to move a pawn or a rook -- or any of the other pieces
            -- does not mean you know how to
            <em>play</em> chess. There are certain patterns/strategies that have
            a higher probability of success and moving your pieces around
            arbitrarily, without any direction or vision for the endgame, is a
            strategy that's almost guaranteed to lose. Likewise, knowing what
            for-loops and while-loops are (and even knowing when to use one over
            the other) does not mean you know how to <em>program</em> -- you
            just learned the rules of the game; the next step is learning the
            patterns/strategies that lead to success (or an app that doesn't
            explode everytime you touch the code base).
