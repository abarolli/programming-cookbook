          <p>
            Learning to code is easy in the same way that learning the rules of
            chess is easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone can learn what a for-loop is. Anyone can learn what a
            while-loop is. Anyone can learn what a variable is... just as easily
            as someone can learn how to move a pawn or a rook, but learning how
            to move a pawn or a rook -- or any of the other pieces -- does not
            mean you know how to
            <em>play</em> chess. There are certain patterns/strategies that have
            a higher probability of success and moving your pieces around
            arbitrarily, without any direction or vision for the endgame, while
            it may not break any rules is a strategy that's almost guaranteed to
            lose. Likewise, knowing what for-loops and while-loops are (and even
            knowing when to use one over the other) does not mean you know how
            to <em>program</em> -- you just learned the rules of the game. The
            next step is learning the patterns/strategies that lead to success
            (or an app that doesn't explode everytime you touch the code base).

            I created this website in an effort to outline some of these high
            level patterns and give pragmatic approaches to satisfy common
            application requirements across all different aspects of software
            engineering. The articles are divided into the specific
            language/framework/technology/topic they pertain to. This is a
            living, breathing document -- like the U.S. Constitution -- that
            I'll be updating constantly.
